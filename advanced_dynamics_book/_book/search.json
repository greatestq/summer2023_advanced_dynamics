    "text": "2.1 Introduction to Three Dimensional Linear Algebra\nIn the realm of practical applications and real-world scenarios, the study of motion necessitates a comprehensive understanding of three-dimensional space. As such, it becomes imperative to delve into the foundations of three-dimensional linear algebra. This branch of mathematics provides the tools and concepts needed to describe and analyze motion in a three-dimensional context.

This foundational knowledge forms an integral part of any comprehensive dynamics book, allowing readers to unlock the fundamental principles underlying the motion of objects and systems in three-dimensional space.\n\n2.1.1 Reference frame\nMotion is described with respect to a reference frame. A reference frame consists of a reference point called the origin and three orthonormal basis vectors. We consider two types of frames: 1. Inertial or fixed, and 2. Body-fixed or moving.\n\nDefinition 2.1 (Reference frame) A reference frame is a set of basis vectors and an origin. We will always be using a set of three orthonormal basis vectors. Notation: \\[\n({\\mathbf{e}_{1}^{(i)}}, {\\mathbf{e}_{2}^{(i)}}, {\\mathbf{e}_{3}^{(i)}}, \\mathbf{r}_{A}^{(i)}),\n\\] or to be concise \\[\n({\\mathbf{e}_{1}^{(i)}}, {\\mathbf{e}_{2}^{(i)}}, {\\mathbf{e}_{3}^{(i)}})\n\\]\n\nwhere \\({\\mathbf{e}_{j}^{(i)}}\\), \\(j=1,2,3\\) are the orthonormal basis vectors and \\(\\mathbf{r}_{A}^{(i)}\\) is the origin, the superscript \\(i\\) is a label to keep track of multiple reference frames. By convention \\(i=0\\) is the fixed (inertial) frame.\nSome of the special properties of the orthonormal basis vectors are that \\[\n\\textbf{e}_{i} \\cdot \\textbf{e}_{j} = \\delta_{ij}\n\\] where \\(i,j=1,2,3\\)\nand\n\\[\n\\textbf{e}_1 \\times \\textbf{e}_2 = \\textbf{e}_3\n\\] \\[\n\\textbf{e}_2 \\times \\textbf{e}_3 = \\textbf{e}_1\n\\] \\[\n\\textbf{e}_3 \\times \\textbf{e}_1 = \\textbf{e}_2\n\\] These two properties are invariant of whichever frame one uses (“superscript-independent”) as long as the three basis vectors are orthonormal.\n\n\n2.1.2 Vectors and Cross Product\nIn the context of kinematics, a vector contains information about the relative position and direction. A single vector can be expressed in infinitely many different ways depending on the choice of a reference frame. In other words, “coordinates” are “frame-dependent”.\nSuppose we have a three dimensional vector \\(\\textbf{r}\\) and a reference frame located at some arbitary origin \\(\\textbf{O}\\) with three orthonormal basis vectors \\({\\mathbf{e}_{1}^{(0)}}, {\\mathbf{e}_{2}^{(0)}}, {\\mathbf{e}_{3}^{(0)}}\\). Then the vector \\(\\textbf{r}\\) can be expressed as following \\[\n\\textbf{r} = r_1{\\mathbf{e}_{1}^{(0)}} + r_2{\\mathbf{e}_{2}^{(0)}} + r_3{\\mathbf{e}_{3}^{(0)}} = \\begin{pmatrix} {\\mathbf{e}_{1}^{(0)}} & {\\mathbf{e}_{2}^{(0)}} & {\\mathbf{e}_{3}^{(0)}} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} r_1 \\\\ r_2 \\\\ r_3 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\] where \\(r_1, r_2, r_3\\) are the “coordinates”. However, these “coordinates” need not be the same in other reference frames.\nOne of the most frequently used vector products in Dynamics is the cross product. Suppose we have some arbitary vectors \\(\\textbf{u}\\) and \\(\\textbf{v}\\) both expressed with respect to the same reference frame. \\[\n\\textbf{u} = \\Sigma_{i=1}^{3}u_i\\textbf{e}_i\n\\] \\[\n\\textbf{v} = \\Sigma_{j=1}^{3}v_j\\textbf{e}_j\n\\] Then the cross product between the two vectors proceed as follows \\[\n\\textbf{u} \\times \\textbf{v} = (u_1\\textbf{e}_1 + u_2\\textbf{e}_2 + u_3\\textbf{e}_3) \\times (v_1\\textbf{e}_1 + v_2\\textbf{e}_2 + v+3\\textbf{e}_3)\n\\] Knuth (1984) for additional discussion of literate programming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip with Title\n\n\n\nThis is an example of a callout with a title.\n\n\nSee Definition 2.1.\n\n\n1.0000000000000004\n1.0\n1.0000000000000004\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, see ?fig-plot.\n\n\n\n\nKnuth, Donald E. 1984. “Literate Programming.” Comput.
