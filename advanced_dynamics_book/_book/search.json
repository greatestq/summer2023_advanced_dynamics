    "text": "3.1 Reference frame\nThe geometry of motion is called kinematics. Motion is described with respect to a reference frame. A reference frame consists of a reference point called the origin and three directions called basis vectors. We consider two types of frames: 1. Inertial or fixed, and 2. Body-fixed or moving.\n\nDefinition 3.1 (Reference frame) A reference frame is a set of basis vectors and an origin. We will always be using a set of three orthonormal basis vectors. Notation: \\[\n({\\mathbf{e}_{1}^{(i)}}, {\\mathbf{e}_{2}^{(i)}}, {\\mathbf{e}_{3}^{(i)}}, \\mathbf{r}_{A}^{(i)}),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\({\\mathbf{e}_{j}^{(i)}}\\), \\(j=1,2,3\\) are the orthonormal basis vectors and \\(\\mathbf{r}_{A}^{(i)}\\) is the origin, the superscript \\(i\\) is a label to keep track of multiple reference frames. By convention \\(i=0\\) is the fixed (inertial) frame.\nKnuth (1984) for additional discussion of literate programming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip with Title\n\n\n\nThis is an example of a callout with a title.\n\n\nSee Definition 3.1.\n\n\n0.9999999999999999\n0.9999999999999998\n0.9999999999999996\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, see ?fig-plot.\n\n\n\n\nKnuth, Donald E. 1984. “Literate Programming.” Comput.
