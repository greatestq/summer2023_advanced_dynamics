It provides a framework for understanding and analyzing the motion of particles, objects, or systems in three-dimensional space. The motivation behind studying kinematics lies in its ability to describe and predtic motion, leading to applications in the controls or optimization of various systems. In Mechanical Engineering, the concepts play a crucial role in various fiels such as controls, robotics, biomechanics, and etc.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](vectors_files/figure-html/cell-2-output-1.png){width=389 height=389}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Introduction to Three Dimensional Linear Algebra\nIn the realm of practical applications and real-world scenarios, the study of motion necessitates a comprehensive understanding of three-dimensional space. As such, it becomes imperative to delve into the foundations of three-dimensional linear algebra. This branch of mathematics provides the tools and concepts needed to describe and analyze motion in a three-dimensional context. By grasping the principles of three-dimensional linear algebra, we gain the ability to navigate and comprehend the complexities inherent in the physical world, enabling us to formulate accurate models and predictions pertaining to dynamics. This foundational knowledge forms an integral part of any comprehensive dynamics book, allowing readers to unlock the fundamental principles underlying the motion of objects and systems in three-dimensional space.\n\n### Reference frame\nMotion is described with respect to a reference frame. A reference frame consists of a reference point called the origin and three orthonormal basis vectors. We consider two types of frames:\n1. Inertial or fixed, and \n2. Body-fixed or moving.\n\n::: {#def-frame}\n### Reference frame\nA reference frame is a set of basis vectors and an origin. We will always be using a set of three orthonormal basis vectors. Notation:\n$$\n(\\bvec{1}{i}, \\bvec{2}{i}, \\bvec{3}{i}, \\orig{A}{i}),\n$$\nor to be concise \n$$\n(\\bvec{1}{i}, \\bvec{2}{i}, \\bvec{3}{i})\n$$\n:::\nwhere $\\bvec{j}{i}$, $j=1,2,3$ are the orthonormal basis vectors and $\\orig{A}{i}$ is the origin, the superscript $i$ is a label to keep track of multiple reference frames. By convention $i=0$ is the fixed (inertial) frame.\n\nSome of the special properties of the orthonormal basis vectors are that \n$$\n\\textbf{e}_{i} \\cdot \\textbf{e}_{j} = \\delta_{ij} \n$$\nwhere $i,j=1,2,3$ \n\nand\n\n$$\n\\textbf{e}_1 \\times \\textbf{e}_2 = \\textbf{e}_3\n$$\n$$\n\\textbf{e}_2 \\times \\textbf{e}_3 = \\textbf{e}_1\n$$\n$$\n\\textbf{e}_3 \\times \\textbf{e}_1 = \\textbf{e}_2\n$$\nThese two properties are invariant of whichever frame one uses (\"superscript-independent\") as long as the three basis vectors are orthonormal. \n\n### Vectors and Cross Product\nIn the context of kinematics, a vector contains information about the relative position and direction. A single vector can be expressed in infinitely many different ways depending on the choice of a reference frame. In other words, \"coordinates\" are \"frame-dependent\".\n\n@knuth84 for additional discussion of literate programming.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Tip with Title\n\nThis is an example of a callout with a title.\n:::\n\nSee @def-frame.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n0.9999999999999998\n0.9999999999999994\n0.9999999999999993\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](vectors_files/figure-html/cell-3-output-2.png){width=401 height=399}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor example, see @fig-plot.\n\n",
